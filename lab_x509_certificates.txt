Public key certificates commonly used (for instance, by web servers/browsers) adhere to the X.509 standard (see the RFCs for all details).

Let's see a Python program that takes, as command-line arguments, a sequences of filenames containing PEM encoded certificates, and:
1) print a summary of each certificate (in particular, its: Issuer, Subject, Validity and whether the corresponding key can be used to sign other certificates)
2) check their signatures
